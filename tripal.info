name = Tripal Theme
description = The Tripal theme provides a custom look-and-feel to data from a Chado database displayed via Tripal modules.  It is a 'base theme' and therefore must be enabled but requires a different theme be set as default.  To use this theme, add the text, 'base theme = tripal', to the end of the default theme's .info file.  The Tripal theme attempts to only provide theming for content derived from Tripal modules without inteferring with the default site theme.
